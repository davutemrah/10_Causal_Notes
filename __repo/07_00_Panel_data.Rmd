# Fixed Effects and Panel Data Methods

## Pooled Regression

**Pooled regression** refers to combining cross-sectional and time series data into a single dataset and estimating a common model without accounting for individual or time-specific effects. This method assumes that all individual observations (from different time periods and entities) share the same underlying regression model.

**Model Form**:

\[ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \]
where:
- \( Y_{it} \) is the dependent variable for entity \( i \) at time \( t \).
- \( X_{it} \) is the independent variable for entity \( i \) at time \( t \).
- \( \epsilon_{it} \) is the error term.

**Limitations**:

**Homogeneity Assumption**: Assumes that the same relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \) holds for all individuals and over time, which may not be realistic.

**Ignored Heterogeneity**: Fails to account for unobserved heterogeneity across entities or over time.

## Panel Data Methods

**Panel data methods** leverage the structure of data that follows the same entities over multiple time periods, allowing for more sophisticated modeling that accounts for individual heterogeneity.

**Advantages**:

**Control for Unobserved Heterogeneity**: By following the same entities over time, we can control for time-invariant characteristics of those entities.

**More Observations**: Increases the number of data points, improving the efficiency of estimations.

**Dynamic Analysis**: Allows studying the dynamics of change over time.

### Fixed Effects Model

The **Fixed Effects (FE) model** is a popular method in panel data analysis that controls for unobserved heterogeneity by allowing each entity to have its own intercept. This method removes time-invariant characteristics from the data, effectively focusing on within-entity variation.

**Model Form**:
\[ Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta X_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \]
where:
- \( \alpha_i \) is the entity-specific intercept.
- \( Y_{it} \) and \( X_{it} \) are as defined above.

**Why Fixed Effects Work**:

**Control for Unobserved Heterogeneity**: By allowing each entity its own intercept, the FE model controls for all time-invariant differences between entities. This is particularly useful if there are omitted variables that are correlated with the included independent variables.

**Elimination of Bias**: Time-invariant characteristics (e.g., cultural factors, institutional differences) are differenced out, reducing the risk of omitted variable bias.

**Within Transformation**:

The FE model can be estimated by demeaning the data:

\[ \overline{Y}_{i} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} Y_{it} \]
\[ \overline{X}_{i} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} X_{it} \]
\[ \overline{\epsilon}_{i} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \epsilon_{it} \]
Then subtract these averages from the original equation:
\[ Y_{it} - \overline{Y}_{i} = \beta (X_{it} - \overline{X}_{i}) + (\epsilon_{it} - \overline{\epsilon}_{i}) \]
This transformation removes \( \alpha_i \) from the equation, allowing for consistent estimation of \( \beta \).

### Random Effects Model

**Random Effects (RE) model** assumes that the entity-specific intercepts are random and uncorrelated with the independent variables. It is more efficient than FE if the assumption holds, but biased if the intercepts are correlated with the regressors.

**Model Form**:
\[ Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta X_{it} + u_i + \epsilon_{it} \]
where \( u_i \) is the random effect.

**Hausman Test**:

- Used to decide between FE and RE models. It tests whether the unique errors (random effects) are correlated with the regressors.

- If the null hypothesis (no correlation) is rejected, the FE model is preferred.

### Example: Economic Growth and Education

Suppose we want to study the impact of education on economic growth using panel data from different countries over several years.

- **Pooled Regression**:
  - Assumes the relationship between education and economic growth is the same across all countries and years.
  - Model: \( \text{Growth}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Education}_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \)
  - Limitation: Ignores country-specific factors (e.g., institutional quality) that might affect growth.

- **Fixed Effects**:
  - Accounts for country-specific unobserved factors that are constant over time (e.g., cultural factors, geographical characteristics).
  - Model: \( \text{Growth}_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 \text{Education}_{it} + \epsilon_{it} \)
  - Interpretation: The coefficient \( \beta_1 \) shows the effect of education on economic growth within the same country over time, controlling for time-invariant factors.

- **Random Effects**:
  - Assumes that the unobserved country-specific effects are uncorrelated with the independent variables.
  - Model: \( \text{Growth}_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Education}_{it} + u_i + \epsilon_{it} \)
  - Interpretation: The coefficient \( \beta_1 \) shows the overall effect of education on economic growth, assuming that the country-specific effects are random.

### Conclusion

- **Pooled Regression**: Simple but ignores heterogeneity.
- **Fixed Effects**: Controls for unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity but only uses within-entity variation.
- **Random Effects**: More efficient if the assumption holds but biased if unobserved effects are correlated with the regressors.
