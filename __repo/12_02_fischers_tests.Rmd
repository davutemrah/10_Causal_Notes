## Fischer's Exact Test

Fisher's Exact Test is a statistical test used to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables. It is particularly useful when sample sizes are small, and the assumptions of the chi-square test (like the expected frequency in each cell being at least 5) are not met. The test is named after the famous statistician Ronald A. Fisher.

### When to Use Fisher’s Exact Test

1. **Small Sample Sizes**: Fisher’s Exact Test is often used when dealing with small sample sizes, where the chi-square test may not be appropriate.
2. **Categorical Data**: It is used for categorical data to test for independence between two variables.
3. **2x2 Contingency Tables**: While the test can be extended to larger tables, it is most commonly applied to 2x2 contingency tables.

### How Fisher's Exact Test Works

#### Example

Consider the following 2x2 contingency table:

|               | Treatment | Control | Total |
|---------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Success**   | a         | b       | a + b |
| **Failure**   | c         | d       | c + d |
| **Total**     | a + c     | b + d   | n     |

Where:
- \(a\): Number of successes in the treatment group
- \(b\): Number of successes in the control group
- \(c\): Number of failures in the treatment group
- \(d\): Number of failures in the control group
- \(n\): Total number of observations

#### Calculating the P-Value

Fisher's Exact Test calculates the exact probability of obtaining a distribution of values in the contingency table given the observed marginal totals. The p-value is computed by summing the probabilities of all possible tables that have the same row and column totals as the observed table and have a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed one.

The probability of any particular table is given by the hypergeometric distribution:

\[ P = \frac{\binom{a+b}{a} \binom{c+d}{c}}{\binom{n}{a+c}} \]

Where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose \(k\) successes out of \(n\) trials.

### Step-by-Step Example

Let’s say we have the following data from a clinical trial:

|               | Treatment | Control |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **Improved**  | 8         | 2       |
| **Not Improved** | 1         | 5       |

We want to test if there is a significant association between the treatment and the improvement.

1. **Construct the Contingency Table**:

   |               | Treatment | Control | Total |
   |---------------|-----------|---------|-------|
   | **Improved**  | 8         | 2       | 10    |
   | **Not Improved** | 1         | 5       | 6     |
   | **Total**     | 9         | 7       | 16    |

2. **Calculate the P-Value**:

   The p-value for Fisher's Exact Test is the sum of the probabilities of all tables that are as extreme as or more extreme than the observed table, given the marginal totals.

   For the given table:

   \[ P = \frac{\binom{10}{8} \binom{6}{1}}{\binom{16}{9}} = \frac{45 \times 6}{11440} \approx 0.0236 \]

3. **Interpret the Result**:

   If the p-value (0.0236) is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between the treatment and the improvement.

### Conclusion

Fisher’s Exact Test is a powerful tool for analyzing contingency tables, especially when sample sizes are small. It provides an exact p-value for the test of independence between two categorical variables, making it a preferred choice when the assumptions of the chi-square test are not satisfied. By using this test, researchers can make accurate inferences about the relationships between categorical variables even in studies with limited data.
